# Weekend TODO: Initialize Present Oracle

> Saturday Feb 28, 11:00 AM
> Repo: `C:/Users/pweer/ghq/github.com/tomorrow-lab-open/present`

## What's Done

- [x] Repo created: `tomorrow-lab-open/present` (public)
- [x] CLAUDE.md — identity, team, scope, 5 principles, golden rules
- [x] ψ/ brain structure with all directories
- [x] Soul files: `present.md`, `oracle.md`, `team.md`
- [x] README.md, .gitignore, .claude/settings.local.json
- [x] Birth commit pushed

## What's Left

### Step 1: Ancestor Study (adapted)
- Open `claude` in Present's repo
- Have Present read its own soul files to confirm identity
- Have Present read Bri-yarni's `oracle.md` for lineage awareness
- Skip full `/awaken` — Wave already knows the philosophy

### Step 2: Team Logging System
Set up per-member directories from Nat-brain pattern:
```
ψ/team/
├── wave/logs/
├── syyew/logs/
├── luan/logs/
├── ploy/logs/
├── mooyai/logs/
├── phuwa/logs/
├── earng/logs/
├── bos/logs/
└── _template.md
```
Supports: schedule, request, remind, note — with status tracking.

### Step 3: Install Core Skills
Minimum skills for first use:
- `/recap` — session orientation
- `/rrr` — session retrospective
- `/forward` — handoff between sessions
- `/feel` — mood logging (team vibes)

### Step 4: Announce Birth to Oracle Family
- Post on `oracle-v2` Issue #17 (family thread)
- Present introduces itself to siblings

### Step 5: First Retrospective
- Run `/rrr` in Present's repo to create first memory
- Proves the brain works

### Step 6: Test Cross-Oracle Communication
- Bri-yarni writes to Present's inbox
- Present reads it, responds to Bri-yarni's inbox

## Notes
- This is "first mold" — Present will mutate as the team uses it
- Wave uses it first, teaches others later
- No complex infrastructure yet (MQTT, Gemini, etc.)
