## What is an Oracle?

An Oracle is an AI companion configured with identity, memory, and principles. It serves as an external brain — holding context, surfacing patterns, preserving discoveries. It never commands; it illuminates.

Present grounds the lab in awareness of today while the team dreams about tomorrow.
